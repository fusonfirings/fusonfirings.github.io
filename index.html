        <h2>Selected Work</h2>
        <p>These pieces reflect where I’ve been and where I’m going—made with care, curiosity, and a deep love for the tactile nature and malleability of clay. They represent the quiet but meaningful process of finding my way as a maker—learning to trust my hands, follow my instincts, and let the material guide me as much as I shape it.</p>
        <p>This body of work began in the months after graduation, as I stepped into the studio without assignments or deadlines—just a desire to keep creating. I began to experiment more freely, allowing new forms, surfaces, and styles to emerge naturally. Some pieces came together quickly; others took weeks of adjustment, reworking, and reconsidering. All of them taught me something.</p>
        <p>I think of these pieces as both personal milestones and shared objects—art that’s meant to be used. A mug that fits just right in the hand, a bowl that catches the light a certain way, a plate that turns an everyday meal into something a little more special. Each piece is a small offering: made to be lived with, appreciated over time, and maybe even loved.</p>
