          <p>
            Curious about the pottery wheel? This beginner-friendly course is the perfect place to start. Over 8 weeks, students will learn the fundamentals of wheel throwing, including centering clay, pulling walls, shaping forms, and trimming. We'll focus on making simple, functional pieces like cups, bowls, and small plates while building comfort and confidence on the pottery wheel. Each class includes instructor demonstrations, step-by-step guidance, and plenty of hands-on time to practice.

          <h3>10-07-2025</h3>
          <p>
            Ready to create something both beautiful and functional? In this six-week course, students will design and craft their own ceramic dining set—think plates, bowls, cups, and more. Using a combination of wheel throwing and handbuilding techniques, we’ll explore form, function, and design, with an emphasis on cohesion and craftsmanship. Along the way, you'll learn about surface decoration, glazing, and how to bring a personal aesthetic to your work. Each session includes hands on
            instruction, demonstrations, and guided studio time to support your creative process. Students will also have one independent open studio session (October 21) to continue working on their pieces outside of class.
